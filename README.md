Go CLI Todo App
A simple, persistent command-line todo application built from scratch.

This project serves as a practical introduction to the Go programming language (Golang), demonstrating core concepts like structs, methods, pointers, file I/O, and the standard library.

🚀 Features
Task Management: Add, list, complete, and delete tasks.

Persistence: Automatically saves tasks to a local todos.json file so data is not lost between runs.

Zero Dependencies: Built entirely using the Go Standard Library (fmt, os, flag, encoding/json, time).

Cross-Platform: Compiles to a single native binary for Windows, macOS, or Linux.
